<p>This is my website about my powers, I am known as math man. Many people have come across me and have not realized my true math power skills. There was one day that I was sitting in class and of course it was math class. I was looking my math book and noticed something different. I could see math calculations in my head, it was amazing. I was solving problems that I couldnt do before, That is when I said to myself, WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY!</p>
